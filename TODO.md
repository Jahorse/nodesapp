# TASK LIST

# Future Tasks
1. Projects to add:
    1. Hive
    2. Tavern
    3. EasyBlock
    4. Polar
    5. Cubo
    6. Bigger Minds
    7. Kingdoms
        - Attempted but couldn't find rewards contract
        - Token: https://ftmscan.com/address/0xd3b8037853785463D06957Fefa0f06Af53B9e504
2. Add feature to enable/disable node protocols in a profile to reduce the amount of calls being made
3. Add more columns:
    - Time until next compound (a few protocols only give daily rewards, so this would only affect them)
    - Add 24 hour token price change column
    - An "adjusted rewards" column that applies bonuses and taxes
4. Update countdown timers to actually count down
5. Add validation https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/components-forms--form-feedback
    - Profile name field
    - Wallet address field
6. Move some of the column buttons to icons under the protocol's name to reduce columns
    - Add icons with links to website, token chart, and swap page
7. Make the claim and compound buttons more accessible on mobile, possibly make each protocol row expanded to be 2 rows, with claim and compound button in second row, this would allow space for the website, chart, and swap icons as well.
8. Add detail views for every project that open when you click the row.
    - More detailed node info: how many, names, IDs, time until claim, etc...
    - Eventually would like to expand to include tokenomics, taxes, stats about number of nodes, holders, burned nodes, etc...
    - Maybe a price chart?

# Ideas
1. Request form for adding nodes https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0tIojm2WPAT_i3lkiv5OVMJRyEC14hm5merqH2NrnaPWUOQ/viewform
1. Upgrade to use https://usedapp.io/ which can track transactions and auto-refresh with new blocks
1. Add token to wallet button (apeboard has this).
