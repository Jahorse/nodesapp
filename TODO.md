# TODO List
1. Move nodes into `Contract` so they are encapsulated and don't need to be passed around.
1. Figure out how to monitor transactions to show when they're complete
1. Add detail views for every project that open when you click the row.
1. The claim and compound buttons should only enable if the wallet address that is claimable is the address of the connected wallet.
  * This requires special treatment of the connected wallet address and the nodes that are attached to it. Should there be a separate table for the connected wallet?
1. Add a column to the table for USD price.
1. Request form for adding nodes https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0tIojm2WPAT_i3lkiv5OVMJRyEC14hm5merqH2NrnaPWUOQ/viewform

# Ideas
1. Should Pentagon tiers be split out? This would be nice visually, but the claim feature would be difficult to use. Maybe only split them out in a detail view.
1. Detail page should have info about tokenomics and maybe a price chart?
